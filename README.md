# Recipe App using ReactJS

This is a practice project from a tutorial by developedbyed on YouTube

It's an exercise intended to demonstrate:

- API calls to a remote API
- routing techniques using react-router-dom
- local storage to reduced the costly effect of API calls on refresh
- logical component structure
- React concepts like useState and useEffect hooks, mapping over lists, etc
- use of some libraries like:
  - styled-components - a React-ified way of using CSS styling
  - framer-motion - custom animation library
  - Splide - a custom React image carousel system
  - react-icons - easily manage and use svg icon files as import

## To run locally

- `npm start` as per usual
